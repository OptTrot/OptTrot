- HEAP type implementation:
    Current `PauliElement_` was implemented with stack type object.
    For the further expansion, it is wise to be modified in Python environment.
    Unfortunately, static implementations are immutable.
    We have to implement the class with heap element.

- The heap version is getting slower as the number of python attributes increases. -> Let them accelerate the routine by provide a static version module.
