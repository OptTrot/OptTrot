# Implementation

- PauliElement list construction in C.

- Accelerate Tensorized Decomposition method
  - Current: Python + JIT method.
  - We have to change the module as AOT compile method.
  - See Numba AOT: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/pycc.html

- PauliPoly strucutre design
  - Current structure: Naive list method ( Too slow ).
  - Methods 
    - (1): Sparse Representation(SR, CSR): Using ij code as matrix index.
      - Pros: Less memory usage. Addition and scalar multiplication are simple.
      - Cons: Pauli Algebra implementation is not easy to get speed advantage comparing to C-api.
    - (2): Numpy object array: 
      - Pros: Easy to implement, just wrapping PauliElements as array, and addtion and Pauli multiplication are well defined.
      - Cons: Addition and matrix multiplication between two PauliPoly object are not simple.


- Hashable type(Done):
  - We want to implement the PauliPoly as set objects or other container.
  - Set object requires hashable type.
  - PauliElement must be a hashable object.

  

- HEAP type implementation(Meaningless):
    Current `PauliElement_` was implemented with stack type object.
    For the further expansion, it is wise to be modified in Python environment.
    Unfortunately, static implementations are immutable.
    We have to implement the class with heap element.

    => Heap types are **too slow** comparing to static object.
    Remain the routines as static object and expending with separated routines.


# Bugs:

- `bignum_tuple_to_pstr`: Conversion error: Occurred when `n` > 31 in `PauliElement`.
