	title = {Graph {Optimization} {Perspective} for {Low}-{Depth} {Trotter}-{Suzuki} {Decomposition}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08602},
	abstract = {Hamiltonian simulation represents an important module in a large class of quantum algorithms and simulations such as quantum machine learning, quantum linear algebra methods, and modeling for physics, material science and chemistry. One of the most prominent methods for realizing the time-evolution unitary is via the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. However, there is a large class of possible decompositions for the infinitesimal time-evolution operator as the order in which the Hamiltonian terms are implemented is arbitrary. We introduce a novel perspective for generating a low-depth Trotter-Suzuki decomposition assuming the standard Clifford+RZ gate set by adapting ideas from quantum error correction. We map a given Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to a constrained path on a graph which we deem the Pauli Frame Graph (PFG). Each node of the PFG represents the set of possible Hamiltonian terms currently available to be applied, Clifford operations represent a move from one node to another, and so the graph distance represents the gate cost of implementing the decomposition. The problem of finding the optimal decomposition is then equivalent to solving a problem similar to the traveling salesman. Though this is an NP-hard problem, we demonstrate the simplest heuristic, greedy search, and compare the resulting two-qubit gate count and circuit depth to more standard methods for a large class of scientifically relevant Hamiltonians, both fermionic and bosonic, found in chemical, vibrational and condensed matter problems which naturally scale. We find in nearly every case we study, the resulting depth and two-qubit gate counts are less than those provided by standard methods, by as much as an order of magnitude. We also find the method is efficient and amenable to parallelization, making the method scalable for problems of real interest.},

We provide necessary and suﬃcient conditions for anticommuting sets to be maximal and present an eﬃcient algorithm for generating anticommuting sets of maximum size. As a theoretical tool, we introduce commutativity maps and study properties of maps associated with elements in the cosets with respect to anticommuting minimal generating sets. We also derive expressions for the number of distinct sets of commuting and anticommuting abelian Paulis of a given size.},

	abstract = {A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},
